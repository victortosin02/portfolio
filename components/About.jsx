          <p className='py-2 text-gray-600'>
            I specialize in building mobile responsive front-end UI and screens 
            for applications. Iâ€™m passionate about learning new technologies and understand there is
            more than one way to accomplish a task. Though I am most proficient
            in building design screens for applications using Figma, Adobe, and
            other design tools. I am a quick learner and can pick up new tech stacks as
            needed. I believe that being a great designer is not using one
            specific tool, but choosing the best tool for the job.
          </p>
          <p className='py-2 text-gray-600'>
            I started product design in 2021 managing by designing screens for
            Learning Managemnt Systems, Mortgage Finder, Laundry Application,
            Logistics App and may more. I have experience designing
            mock wireframes and prototypes for designed applications. I also conduct 
            UX development, feasibility and competitor analysis to ensure that the User
            Interface ensures an engaging user experience for application end users
